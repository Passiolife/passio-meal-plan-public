# Passio Meal Plan API Demo and Reference Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains an API demo and reference implementation for the Passio Meal Plan API.
The API enables meal plan generation based on dietary preferences, allergies, and nutritional goals.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up and run a demo locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/passio-ai/meal-plan-api.git
cd meal-plan-api
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add your Passio API key:

```ini
PASSIO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts a local development server. Open http://localhost:3000 to test the meal plan demo.

## üõ† API Endpoints

## Meal Planner FAQ

### Input Data in our demo implementation (this repository)

**Will we need to make a separate request for each day of the meal plan?**

- By default, the endpoint can generate up to 7 days. But you may need to experiment with to get the best results.

**What information is optional? Specifically we may not have physicalStats, healthConditions, goals, preferenceNotes**

- All of the inputs are optional. Even with no inputs, the endpoint will generate a meal plan. But as you provide more information, the meal plan will be more personalized and adhere to the information you provide.

**I'm not sure we were planning to separate dietaryRestrictions and allergies. Is it better if we do separate them?**

- It will not impact the functionality of the endpoint. We separated them just for the ease of use.

**What is the difference between preview and full meal plan?**

- You can use preview to quickly generate a meal plan, edit it and use it as an input into a full API, or you can just use the full API from the start. If you use the full API from the start the generation will take a bit longer and will be a bit less accurate if you‚Äôre trying to exactly match macros.

### Output Data 

**If as mentioned above we are looping through to create multiple days for the meal plan will the shoppingList accumulate the values for each day or would we have to do that?**

- The API returns multiple days in the response, with a consolidated shopping list for all days. The reference implementation in this repository demonstrates how to display a single day, but the full response contains data for all requested days.

**How are macros calculated for recipes?**

- Macros are calculated based on the nutritional information of each ingredient in the recipe. The API provides detailed macro information for each meal and for the entire day.

**Can I customize portion sizes?**

- Yes, the demo implementation includes an ingredient editor that allows adjusting portion sizes. The API will recalculate macros based on the new portions.
